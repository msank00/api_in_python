# :rocket: Simple Python API for ML project

- This meta project consists of simple script which can be used to create machine learning API in python which includes separate template for creating `preprocessing`, `training` and `prediction` API along with `logging` and `basic error` handling facility. 
- The preprocessing, training, prediction module consists of dummy code which you can fill as per your wish.
- The APIs are created in 2 different ways:
  - Bare flask API
  - Swagger based API

## :star: Simple api using `flask`

- Kindly look into the `simple_api/` directory [here](https://github.com/msank00/api_in_python/tree/master/simple_api).

## :star: Swagger based api using `FastAPI`:

Swagger helps for API documentation which is quite helpful and a good practice. 

- Kindly look into the `swagger_api/` directory [here](https://github.com/msank00/api_in_python/tree/master/swagger_api).
